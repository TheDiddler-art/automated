DETAILED ATTACK EXPLANATIONS
==========================

1. WIFI ATTACKS
--------------
a) Network Scanning (airodump-ng):
   - Passively captures WiFi packets
   - Identifies networks in range
   - Shows: SSID, MAC, Channel, Encryption
   - Detects connected clients
   - Monitors signal strength
   - Reveals hidden networks

b) WPA/WPA2 Handshake Capture:
   - Monitors authentication process
   - Captures 4-way handshake
   - Can be used for offline cracking
   - Works on WPA/WPA2 networks
   - Doesn't break encryption directly
   - Requires client reconnection

c) Deauthentication Attack:
   - Forces clients to disconnect
   - Sends deauth packets to AP
   - Disrupts network connectivity
   - Can target specific clients
   - Used to capture handshakes
   - Effective against all WiFi versions

d) Evil Twin Attack:
   - Creates identical fake AP
